# Graph-Library
I made a graph library in c to get better with pointers, data structures, and algorithms
Every data structure was made from scratch

DESIGN: 
  link-list based graph (each vertice contains a linked list with its adjacent neighbors and their respective weights)
ALGORITHMS:
  Depth First Search 
  
  Breadth First Search using queue
  
  Dijkstra's Shortest Path
